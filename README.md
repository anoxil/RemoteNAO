# RemoteNAO
Control your NAO robot remotely from a smartphone.

This project is divided in three parts:
* *RemoteNAO-client-mobile* : the mobile app to control the NAO robot from anywhere in the world.
* *RemoteNAO-server* : the server which links every client by transmitting all the data.
* *RemoteNAO-client-host* : the ROS package for the computer connected on the same network as the NAO.

**You can find detailed info for each of these parts in their respective folder's README.**
